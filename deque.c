// A dequeue is an ordered set of elements in which elements
// may be inserted or retrieved from either end. Using an array
// simulate a dequeue of characters and the operations retrieve
// left, retrieve right, insert left, insert right. Exceptional
// conditions such as dequeue full or empty should be indicated.
// Two pointers (namely, left and right) are needed in this
// simulation.
